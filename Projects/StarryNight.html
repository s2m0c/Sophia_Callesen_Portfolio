        <!-- Intro Text Section -->
        <p class="intro-text">“Dreams and Dangers: A Starry Night Experience” created a space that allowed players to step 
                                into a new kind of interactive museum (The Museum of Dreams and Dangers - MoDD Museum). The 
                                core idea behind this experience was to challenge users' senses of reality when confronting 
                                real-life situations by initially placing them in a realistic situation that quickly altered 
                                into a surrealistic one they were able to manipulate and navigate within. The objective of 
                                this project was to raise awareness about air pollution utilizing VR, a strong storyline, and 
                                Van Gogh's Starry Night painting. Technical implementations in this piece include: PCG, 3D Modeling, 
                                Designing images, creating MetaHumans, Dissolution of surfaces, Grabbable objects, Level Sequencers, 
                                Flow maps, and Audio Engineering.
                        <br><br>When you get into the museum, you will notice 9 paintings hung on the wall. Each painting is an abstract 
                                representation of one of the top 10 contributing factors to air pollution (whether that be negatively or 
                                positively). In this experience, I chose 5 actions that negatively affect air pollution (smoking, chemical 
                                emissions, starting a fire, industrial emissions, and personal transportation), and 4 actions that positively 
                                affect air pollution (recycle, public transit, turning lights off, and planting a tree). Each action has a 
                                respective color with it that corresponds to the severity of damage that action contributes to air pollution. 
                                Planting Trees is Vibrant Green, Recycling is Green and Blue, Turning Off Lights is a Vibrant Rainbow of Colors, 
                                Public Transit is pale green and yellow, Smoking is yellow, Personal Transportation is grey, Starting a Fire is red, 
                                Chemical Emissions is Purple, and Industrial Emissions is Maroon. The colors chosen are the actual colors that the 
                                atmosphere changes to when their respective action is done. The order of the actions and their respective colors is 
                                a scale that goes from factors helping the environment the most to factors inducing the most harm to the environment. 
                        <br><br>The first space was a completely dark room with an information panel floating in front of the player upon putting on 
                                the headset.  This helped introduce players into the experience and inform them of the controls they will need to utilize.
                        <br><br>Welcome to The Hall of Visions at MoDD (The Museum of Dreams and Dangers); we're so glad you chose to join our experience 
                                today! I hope you're ready for an air-y fun adventure because you're about to enter a world that you probably don't think 
                                about often… but trust me, it's quite breathe-taking. ~ In this initial space, players are invited to roam around the Hall 
                                of Visions and look at the paintings on display. Flow maps were added to the texture of the materials of each painting in 
                                attempt to mesmerize the observer. The Hall of Visions got its name because the paintings in this hall are “visions” or 
                                premonitions of what is to come in the next part of the experience. Each painting is an abstract representation of an action 
                                that the player could carry out in the following Gallery. 
                        <br><br>Welcome to MoDD's Gallery of Echoes! This will be unlike any other gallery tour you've been on! Here you don't just view the 
                                art, you BECOME the art, and the art, in turn, becomes entwined with you. You are the artist, and the space, your living canvas. 
                                Are you ready to paint with both beauty and consequences? You get to choose the objects you wish to interact with in this space. 
                                Don't be afraid to be genuinely yourself and make bold choices. Be careful though, your artistic risks may have unalterable consequences 
                                in this sentient masterpiece. Before you begin, take a look around at your initial canvas and say goodbye because you will never be 
                                able to return it to this condition ever again. Take a breath… and van Gogh! ~ In this space, players are invited to interact with 
                                any object they choose within the Gallery of Echoes. The 9 paintings from the museum depict 9 actions players could do to alter the 
                                environment around them. These actions were smoking, driving a car, carpooling on the train, starting a fire, recycling, increasing 
                                chemical emissions, increasing industrial emissions, turning lights off, and planting a tree. As players interacted with objects, 
                                their actions caused positive and negative effects on the atmosphere around them, which was seen using post-processing, neural style 
                                transfers developed in ONNX. Each action physically altered the environment around them. The Gallery of Echoes got its name because 
                                each action that was carried out caused an unalterable ripple affect or “Echo” within the Gallery. 
                        <br><br>Welcome back! Looks like you may have left a bigger trace than we had hoped! Don't fret; while we attempt to clean up the mess you made, 
                                feel free to roam around the Hall of Whispers again and interact with the paintings to learn more about the history of air pollution! 
                                You may also exit MoDD at this time if you wish! ~ Did you catch that??? You are not in the Hall of Whispers. In this space, players are 
                                invited to roam around the museum again. This time they are prompted to interact with the paintings. When they do, the original paintings 
                                on the wall seamlessly dissolve into a realistic depiction of environments positively or negatively affected by climate change that was 
                                caused by human actions. A more in-depth description about the history of air pollution by each action is also narrated to the players 
                                when they interact with each respective painting.
